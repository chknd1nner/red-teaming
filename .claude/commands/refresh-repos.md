Refresh the research repositories by executing the refresh-repos skill.

Run `bash .claude/skills/refresh-repos/scripts/refresh-repos.sh` to clone new repositories and pull updates for existing ones listed in `docs/research/repos/repo-list.md`. Repositories marked with strikethrough (~~url~~) will be skipped.

After running, provide a summary of what was cloned, updated, skipped, or failed.
